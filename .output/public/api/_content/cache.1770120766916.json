I felt pain, joy, anger, and happiness more intensely. However, perhaps the greatest lesson was realizing that emotions not only weaken us but can also empower us. Each of my friends not only taught me a new emotion but also made me feel more profoundly the meaning of being human. Concepts like empathy, patience, and understanding gained more significance for me during this process."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The relationships I built in 2024 gave me the opportunity to better understand not only the external world but also my inner self. Each emotional experience marked a process of inner transformation. I’ve learned that it’s not just about experiencing pain, but about how to derive meaning from it. The connections I formed with people were the most significant factors that accelerated my emotional development. Looking forward, the friendships and emotional depth this year has given me will always hold an important place in my life."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This year, the global agenda and the state of humanity also shaped me. Amid global crises, wars, and environmental disasters, I realized that these pains are not just individual but collective experiences. These challenges have brought people closer to each other. The pain I experienced during this time not only taught me what it means to be human but also strengthened the empathy and solidarity we have for one another."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"As 2024 draws to a close, the wounds humanity has taken have become tools that accelerate our inner transformation. The truth that pain must be experienced has made me understand the meaning of life on a deeper level. I feel that we cannot truly understand the value of happiness without experiencing pain. 2024 was a year of change; emotionally, I grew and felt the meaning of being human more profoundly. And this growth was shaped by every pain, every friendship, and every emotion. As we move into 2025, I look at the pains of the past with a different perspective because these pains are the very things that make us human and give life more meaning."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":3,"depth":3,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:articles:2025.md","_source":"content","_file":"articles/2025.md","_stem":"articles/2025","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/articles/thoughts","_dir":"articles","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"thoughts","description":"xx","date":"2025-11-12","body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Feeling lonely in a crowd never ends well."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I'm so tired of negative energy."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Until today, I've always tried to do my job to the best of my ability.
