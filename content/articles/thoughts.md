Feeling lonely in a crowd never ends well.

I'm so tired of negative energy.

Until today, I've always tried to do my job to the best of my ability. I never even cared about the money; it was all about gaining respect.

From now on, I'm moving into a work rhythm where I feel better.

Why all this effort?

I'm the kind of person who can be happy with small things, yet I try to see everyone around me happy, and I'm realizing it's not possible.

I no longer want to prevent any problems that might arise, nor do I want to solve them when they do.

In this long void, I'm starting to envy the small things people have that they fail to appreciate.

I'm writing these things down to see what I've been overlooking. I don't even remember the last time I did what I wanted to do.

I need to apologize to everyone I've hurt, respect my work, and keep doing the one thing I know how to do best.

For someone who is emotional in their relationships, this is a dungeon.

I'm writing this for my friends who refuse to show any understanding. The old "Pasha" (The old me) is gone; he's dead.

The flaws start to show, and you find yourself trying to win a war waged more against yourself than against the world around you.

In the end, it's a dream. It seems this was the story of my dreams all along.

I prayed for rain, and now I have to endure the mud.

You decide whether you are the rain or the mud.

As for me, I am used to the mud, and I know very well how to get clean.
